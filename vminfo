'''Manbearpig3130's Virtual Gaming Machine:'''
Hardware:
* '''CPU''': Intel Core i7-6850K
* '''Motherboard''': Gigabyte x99-Ultra Gaming-CF (Revision 1.0, BIOS/UEFI Version: F4)
* '''Host GPU''': AMD R9 390
* '''Guest GPU''': NVIDIA 2080TI
* '''RAM''': 32GB G-Skill Ripjaws DDR4 3333MHz

Configuration:
* '''Host Kernel''': Kernel version Linux 5.3.12.1-1
* Using '''libvirt QEMU/KVM with OVMF''': link to domain XMLs/scripts/notes: https://github.com/manbearpig3130/MBP-VT-d-gaming-machine
* '''Host OS''': Arch Linux
* '''Guest OS''': Windows 10 Pro
* 2TB Intel 660P NVMe SSD containing the .raw image file for guest OS. Attempted PCI passthrough without success. Will try again one day when perhaps the issue is patched.
* USB Host controller is passed through, giving most USB ports to the VM, leaving my USB 3.1 controller with attached USB hub for the host.
* Motherboard has two NICs, one is passed into VM (Works after installing Killer NIC Driver).
* VM gets dedicated 16GB RAM via static hugepages.
* CPU pinning increased performance considerably.
* Windows boots straight into Steam big picture mode on it's primary display. 
* Runs Valve Index flawlessly. 2080TI also includes USB-C port which the index is plugged into.
* Setting up IOthreads properly greatly helped with stuttering during disk usage (steam downloads)
Overall an awesome gaming machine that meets my gaming needs and lust for GNU/Linux at the same time.
