=== Manbearpig3130's Original Virtual Gaming Machine ===

Hardware:

* '''CPU''': Intel Core i7-6850K 3.6GHz
* '''Motherboard''': Gigabyte x99-Ultra Gaming (Revision 1.0, BIOS/UEFI Version: F4)
* '''Host GPU''': AMD Radeon HD6950 1GB
* '''Guest GPU''': AMD R9 390 8GB
* '''RAM''': 32GB G-Skill Ripjaws DDR4 running at 3200MHz

Configuration:

* '''Host Kernel''': Kernel version Linux 4.7.2-1.
* Using '''libvirt QEMU/KVM with OVMF''': link to domain XMLs/scripts/notes: https://github.com/manbearpig3130/MBP-VT-d-gaming-machine
* '''Host OS''': Arch Linux
* '''Guest OS''': Windows 10 Pro
* 2x 480GB SSDs set up in LVM striped mode (with mdadm) formatted to ext4 are mounted in linux which contains the guest's qcow2 virtual VirtIO disk file.
* USB Host controller is passed through, giving most USB ports to the VM, leaving my USB 3.1 controller with attached USB hub for the host.
* Motherboard has two NICs, one is passed into VM (Works perfectly after installing Killer NIC Driver).
* VM gets dedicated 16GB RAM via static hugepages.
* CPU pinning increased performance considerably.
* Windows boots straight into Steam big picture mode on primary display (43" Sony Bravia). Overall an awesome gaming machine that meets my gaming needs and wants for GNU/Linux at the same time.

'''Quirks''':

* I sometimes have to reinstall the AMD drivers in Windows to get HDMI audio working properly, or roll back to Windows HDMI driver. I normally use a USB headset which works fine anyway.

* '''Guest OS''': Windows 10 Pro
* 2TB Intel 660P NVMe SSD passed through as storage. This needed a firmware update (sm2262 chipset) to pass through properly, but now that it works I also have the option to boot directly into Windows exclusively if I want to

* CPU pinning increased performance considerably.
* Windows boots straight into Steam big picture mode on primary display.
* Intel 9260 Wifi + Bluetooth M.2 card passed through for Xbox Series X/S controller
* Valve Index VR headset works perfectly in VM
* '''Quirks''':
* I have issues with one of my USB controllers, it seems like it stutters or resets. I can mitigate this by plugging devices into other USB busses, such as that on the 2080ti and also my USB 3.1 bus. This problem only occues in Windows. I originally thought it was due to it being in a VM, but since I set up my NVMe passthrough and can boot into Windows directly now I still have the same problem. Doesn't happen at all on Linux
